This repo will be for the whole class. Use your big brain and keep it appropriate. In addition, each group will have different branches. Please stay on your groups branches. 

Please look at your group on discord to find which group branch you should be working on.

OK.  So next time we have a global pandemic, I will set up the repo, and the first four on-line lectures will be about how to navigate the repo.

Thanks very much for pulling together and setting this up.
